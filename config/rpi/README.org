* Introduction

  The 'rpi' board supports the "Raspberry Pi", a credit-card sized low
  cost linux computer. The SLIM board support was developed using a
  cross compiler built with crosstool-ng. Detailed instructions on how
  to obtain a cross compiler can be found here:

* Compiling the Image

  - export BOARD=rpi
  - . scripts/env.sh
  - make

* Installing the Image

  Insert a SD card into your development machine and use the following
  command to copy the image onto it:

  - dd if=rpi/rpi-sdcard.img of=/dev/sdX

  (Replace /dev/sdX with the device node of the SD card. You can use
  'dmesg' to find out what device node to use.)

* Booting the Image

  Insert the SD card with the image on it into the Raspberry Pi and
  power on the device.
