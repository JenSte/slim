* Introduction

  The 'imx35pdk board supports the Freescale i.MX35 PDK, a development
  board for the i.MX35. For this board, the cross compiler provided
  by Freescale is based on GCC 4.1.2.

* Compiling the Image

  - export BOARD=imx35pdk
  - make
  - make install

* Booting the Image

  This section describes how to use the RAM disk file system. We
  assume here that SLIM variable CONFIG_tftp_dir is /home/tftp and the
  Linux kernel you want to use is /home/tftp/uImage. In order to use a
  RAM disk file system, your Linux kernel must have the following
  options.

  CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD=y
  CONFIG_BLK_DEV_RAM=y
  CONFIG_EXT2_FS=y

** RAM disk root file system, fetch kernel and rootfs via TFTP

   load -r -b 0xa00000 imx35pdk-initrd.gz -h 192.168.0.10
   load -r -b 0x100000 zImage -h 192.168.0.10
   exec -r 0xa00000 -s 0x2000000 -c "console=ttymxc0,115200 ramdisk_size=65536 root=/dev/ram0"
